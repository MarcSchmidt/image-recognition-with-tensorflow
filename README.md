# image-recognition-with-tensorflow
A project to train a convolutional neural network with keras on a MacOS Cluster with the help Docker & Kubernetes.

# Train the Model
To train the model just execute the python script.
```bash
python cnn.py
```
The performance of the Model can be viewed with Tensorboard.
```bash
tensorboard --logdir=logs/
```
